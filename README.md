# Nags-with-Notions

Nags with Notions is a website that hopes to inform customers about the delicious
pizzas on offer. The aim is to attract customers to purchase pizzas by having
the site look appealing and easy to use. Information such as opening times, menu,location
and how to pre-book pizzas is included. Links to Nags with Notions social media accounts 
are provided. The code behind this section was heavily reliant on the Love Running Club navigation section in the Code Institute tutorial.

# Features

## Navigation Bar

On all 3 pages there is a link to the Home page, menu and feedback form. 
This allows for easier navigation between the pages.
As the screen decreases in width the navigation buttoms go underneath the main heading.
A line appears under the navigation buttons, when hoovered over. The text remains underlined 
for the current page.

## Video

Video taken from youtube. This video was implemented to give viewers a feel for the natural style of making pizzas, which hopefully will remind them why home baked meals are better than something you would buy in a store.

## Bugs

# Solved bugs

When using media query to adapt the screensize to mobiles the logo would not drop down correctly. The formating of the logo and surrounding text had to be changed to address this. Tutor support was required.

Images would not upload on the readme, as their were gaps in the image names. Tutor support was required. 

# Unfixed bugs
