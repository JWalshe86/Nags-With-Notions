# Nags-with-Notions

Nags with Notions is a website that hopes to inform customers about the delicious
pizzas on offer. The aim is to attract customers to purchase pizzas by having
the site look appealing and easy to use. Information such as opening times, menu,location
and how to pre-book pizzas is included. Links to Nags with Notions social media accounts 
are provided. The code behind this section was heavily reliant on the Love Running Club navigation section in the Code Institute tutorial.

# User-Experience

## As a new visitor

I would like to understand what the product is
I would like to be able to find information on the website easily
I would like to know the menu, contact, prices, location and opening times
I would like social media links to other content by the supplier

## As a returning visitor

I would like to be able to give feedback on the product
I would like to see any updates on the menu or venue location

# Design (UXD)

## Strategy

Recently, the pizzeria went from staying in the one location (behind a pub) to going whereever
there's a demand. 

The mobile pizzeria has since received many requests from different venues: festivals, weddings, concerts etc. 

Due to the mobile nature of the business the pizzeria needs a strong online presence so people
can be informed about their services. 

By having a responsive, easy to use website Nags with Notions hopes users can see exactly what's on offer and are enticed to acquire Nags with Notions services. 

## Scope

# Wireframe

An initial blueprint of the project was created using balsamiq wireframes. This wireframe
was presented to ones mentor Anthony during the first of three meet ups.

the Nags with Notions logo.

# Features

## Navigation Bar

On all 3 pages there is a link to the Home page, menu and feedback form. 
This allows for easier navigation between the pages.
As the screen decreases in width the navigation buttoms go underneath the main heading.
A line appears under the navigation buttons, when hoovered over. The text remains underlined 
for the current page.

## Video

Video taken from youtube. This video was implemented to give viewers a feel for the natural style of making pizzas, which hopefully will remind them why home baked meals are better than something you would buy in a store.

#Performance Testing

Google Chromes Lighthouse tool was used to measure the sites performance. 
![lighthouse-review](assets/images/readme-images/lighthouse-performance.png)

Lighthouse highlighted how the sites responsiveness was being compromised by not having images compressed or at the correct sizes for certain devices. 

![lighthouse-menu-post-edits](assets/images/readme-images/menu-lighthouse-post-edits.png)

For the menu page Lighthouse highlighted how some of the images were distorted and that the social media icons had poor accessability.

## Bugs

# Solved bugs

When using media query to adapt the screensize to mobiles the logo would not drop down correctly. The formating of the logo and surrounding text had to be changed to address this. Tutor support was required.

Images would not upload on the readme, as their were gaps in the image names. Tutor support was required. 

# Unfixed bugs

# Deployment

The site was deployed on github pages.
