# Nags-with-Notions

Nags with Notions is a website that hopes to inform customers about the delicious
pizzas on offer. The aim is to attract customers to purchase pizzas by having
the site look appealing and easy to use. Information such as opening times, menu,location
and how to pre-book pizzas is included. Links to Nags with Notions social media accounts
are provided. The code behind this section was heavily reliant on the Love Running Club navigation section in the Code Institute tutorial.

The responsiveness of the website was checked on [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) and is displayed below.

# Design (UXD)

## Strategy

Recently, the pizzeria went from staying in the one location (behind a pub) to going whereever
there's a demand. 

The mobile pizzeria has since received many requests from different venues: festivals, weddings, concerts etc. 

Due to the mobile nature of the business the pizzeria needs a strong online presence so people
can be informed about their services. 

By having a responsive, easy to use website Nags with Notions hopes users can see exactly what's on offer and are enticed to acquire Nags with Notions services. 

## Scope

The scope covered the needs of the customers and ensuring these needs were met. 

The site provides customers with an explanation of the service and what's on offer. The customer can easily nagivatie through the website to find information. The main constraints are only css and html could be used, the authors inexperience and the time-limit. Another constraint was the lack of high quality images of the Nags with Notions pizzeria.

## Skeleton

# Wireframe

An initial blueprint of the project was created using balsamiq wireframes. This wireframe was presented to ones mentor Anthony during the first of three meet ups. The styling and layout significantly changed as the project progressed but the core structure remained. 

![Wireframe](assets/images/readme-images/wireframe4.png)

## Surface

### Colour Palette

The colour palette was generated using coolors.com. The colours used were warm and relaxing just like Nags with Notions. The font used was Open Sans, which is specifically used for its legibility. 

### Imagery 

All the images came from Pexels.com except one. The 3 pizza hero image was taken by 
[Narda-Yescas](<https://www.pexels.com/@narda-yescas-724842/>). 
[Vincent-Rivaud](https://www.pexels.com/@vince/) the blue cheese and gormet fries images. [CoolShooters](https://www.pexels.com/@koolshooters/) took the images of both 'Tamara' and 'Caroline' eating pizza in the about section. [Geraud-Pfeiffer](https://www.pexels.com/@geraud-pfeiffer/) the nachos. [Ahmed-Rabea](<https://www.pexels.com/@ahmed-rabea-2883687/>) the toasted sandwich. [Andrea-Picquadio](<https://www.pexels.com/@olly/>) the couple booking something image. The image of the pizza truck came from istockphotos.com and is credited to [Maica](https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/Maica?mediatype=photography). 

### Iconography

The company logo ![tiny-logo](assets/images/test2.jpg) was taken from the Nags with Notions FB page. The hamburger menu for smaller screens ![Navigation-bar-small](assets/images/readme-images/nav-bar-smallscreen.png) and social media icons ![social-media-icons](assets/images/readme-images/social-media-icons.png) came from fontawesome.com. 


# Features

## Navigation Bar

On all 3 pages there is a link to the Home page, menu and feedback form. 
This allows for easier navigation between the pages. Clicking on the Nags with Notions title also brings one to the home page. 

![Navigation-bar-full](assets/images/readme-images/nav-bar-fullscreen.png)

As the screen decreases in width a clickable dropdown menu is presented.

![profiles-image](assets/images/readme-images/profiles-readme.png)

## Reviews

The reviews section provides validation for users that the product on offer is of high quality and has received great feedback from the public. This assures viewers about their purchase.

## Video

Video taken from youtube. This video was implemented to give viewers a feel for the natural style of making pizzas, which hopefully will remind them why home baked meals are better than something you would buy in a store.

![validator-testing-1](assets/images/readme-images/validator-testing-1.png)

![validator-testing-2](assets/images/readme-images/validator-testing-2.png)

![validator-testing-3](assets/images/readme-images/validator-testing-3.png)

After addressing all 11 issues a re-run of the site through the WC3 validator found no errors.

1 error found for all pages when the site was deployed through the css W3C validator

#Performance Testing

Google Chromes Lighthouse tool was used to measure the sites performance. 
![lighthouse-review](assets/images/readme-images/lighthouse-performance.png)

Lighthouse highlighted how the sites responsiveness was being compromised by not having images compressed or at the correct sizes for certain devices. For the menu page Lighthouse highlighted how some of the images were distorted and that the social media icons had poor accessability. 

![lighthouse-menu-post-edits](assets/images/readme-images/menu-lighthouse-post-edits.png)


![lighthouse-home-post-edits](assets/images/home-post-edit-lighthouse.png)

![lighthouse-contact-post-edits](assets/images/readme-images/contact-post-lighthouse-edits.png)

The deployed website was also posted on Slacks peer-review-channel. Colleagues helped highlight performance issues and the correction of a blurry image. 

-------------------
## Bugs

# Solved bugs

When using media query to adapt the screensize to mobiles the logo would not drop down correctly. The formating of the logo and surrounding text had to be changed to address this. Tutor support was required.

Images would not upload on the readme, as their were gaps in the image names. Tutor support was required. 

# Unfixed bugs

# Deployment

The site was deployed on github pages.
